1. non cod account -> details must be added {Soon be done}
2. return managemnt {done}
3. if vendor cannot meet the target then charges will be dynamic {soon be discussed}
4. d/ff routes for each vendor {done}
5. timer for rider to meet target in assigned time. {done}
6. if target time is not meet then notify the admin. {Soon be done}



Q? 
how the order amount be decide and where , how we create a formula to decide the amount 
like does amount automatically generate using the inputs while the user create the order,
how far the delivery is , weight , assigning discounts etc

as of now it is decided that order created and how to assign the rider and if canceled 
then handle, but now how to assign rider to drop the package to the user. should we create
different route for delivery.

as you said that for vendors discount will be granted to the vendor but where the discount
be assigned like does the admin open up the route of user and then grant the discount or 
is it also dynamic like if user done 100+ order then autiomatically assign certain % discount
while creating the order. or you will grant discount coupon code like through email and through 
that coupon code assigned by the admin vendor will enter it while creating the order and then 
he gets discount and if he dont meet the target then admin can have power to make the coupon
code useless.

Am I right that for creating the order vendor will have options 
1. cod (cash on delivery)
    b. manual one by one order
    a. bulk order 
2. non cod
    b. manual one by one order
    a. bulk order 

for bulk order we can use xlsx library to read the excel sheet and we will do error handling 
so that all of the required fields are present there and then we allow vendor to confirm order
by seeing it, now the question is that how we will confirm the order, just like in manual to 
confirm each order or to see all to recheck and confirm all at once and then qr code and
order detail will be shown in one pdf.




//for location 
// Simple implementation
const showUserLocation = () => {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
            const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
            const mapsUrl = `https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=${latitude},${longitude}`;
            window.open(mapsUrl, '_blank');
        });
}
